# ControlDigitCalc 
From some time had in my head a question how control digit of land register book is calculated. Ok it is possible to make in excel,
but it is no about it.Currently my main activity is attached to Java and related subjects. That'sinking when I was thinking about 
easy program were Spring and JUnit test coul dbe be used, I decided to make this simple example - finally learned a lot about beans.

The main reason of loading this code to gitHub is to show 3 different method of possible beans creation:
- fully in XML,
- partly by XML and annotations,
- with SmartGit support
and some JUnit test - (unfortunately woitout mochito).

If you have any furhter quesstions please do not hestate and contact me. Will be glad to discuss code.
