# ControlDigitCalc 
From some time had in my head a question how control digit of land register book is calculated. Found a soultion and test it in excel and after that came idea.. lets code it. Currently my main activity is attached to Java and related subjects. That's why I decided to write easy program were Spring and JUnit test could be be used, I decided to make this simple example - and as it was not dificult finally learned a lot about beans.

The main reason of loading this code to gitHub is to show 3 different method of possible beans creation:
- fully in XML,
- partly by XML and annotations,
- with Java configuration file support
and some JUnit test - (unfortunately without mochito).

If you have any furhter quesstions please do not hestate and contact me. Will be glad to discuss code with you.
